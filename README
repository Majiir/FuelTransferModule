Currently, you need to be within 2000 meters (2km) of the source/destination vessels (i.e. if you are transfering fuel from some other ship to the currently controlled ship, they need to be within 2km of you).
This works for both RCS and Regular (rocket and airplane) fuel.

Changelist:
0.2.1:
- Fixed the IFuelSource interface so that it auto-works with other plugins that implement it.
- Fixed bug in getting fuel from regular fuel tanks.
- You can now grab fuel from debris.

0.2.0:
 - Added KSPMM compatibility
 - added interface IFuelSource - Non RCS/fueltanks can use this module now!

(Thanks Mirosta!)

0.1.1:
