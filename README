Currently, you need to be within 2000 meters (2km) of the source/destination vessels (i.e. if you are transfering fuel from some other ship to the currently controlled ship, they need to be within 2km of you).
This works for both RCS and Regular (rocket and airplane) fuel.

Todo: 
 - Texture work
 - Produces a fuelline from the transfer module to the source/destination tank?
